    "## What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Entity Resolution Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent or duplicate customer records are a common challenge in modern data platforms. Whether caused by typos, multiple sign-ups, or disconnected systems, these issues can impact reporting, personalization, and fraud detection. Graph algorithms help by comparing relationships and properties to identify overlapping entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN/neo4j-neo4j-graph-analytics) for Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Need:\n",
    "- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Build:\n",
    "- A graph-based model that normalizes profile attributes as separate nodes\n",
    "- A method to use graph-based similarity and community detection for entity resolution  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to reshape tabular data into a normalized graph model\n",
    "- How to use FastRP and KNN to identify structurally similar profiles\n",
    "- How to cluster profiles with Louvain for deduplication\n",
    "- How to visualize the graphs in the notebook itself\n",
    "- How to read and write directly from and to your Snowflake tables\n",

    "This dataset contains multiple customer identities with potential duplicates across name, contact, and address fields. The goal is to resolve identities into unique profiles by connecting shared attributes as graph nodes.\n",

    "For the purposes of the demo, the database will be named `ER_DEMO`. Using the CSV, `er_mock_data.csv`, found [here](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/entity-resolution), we are going to create a new table called `CUSTOMER_ENTITIES_DEMO_DATA` via the Snowsight data upload method. \n",

The Neo4j app requires the creation of a few different roles. But before we get started granting different roles, we need to ensure that you are using `accountadmin` to grant and create roles.
