   "source": "# Modeling Disruptions in the MTA Subway\n## Overview\n\n### What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake? \n\nNeo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. **Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake** brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake! \n\n\n### Modeling Disruptions in the MTA Subway\n\n3.6 million Americans ride the New York City subway each day. That's 1.3 million more people than who takes a flight each day in the United States. The New York City Subway is unique in the number of riders, stations, and the level of service it provides.\n\nUsing Aura Graph Analytics, we can easily model what would happen if a station was fully closed for repairs. Insights like this can apply not just to transport systems, but to supply chains, manufacturing processes and much more.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN) for Snowflake\n  \n### What You Will Need\n- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below:\n![image](assets/marketplace.png)\n\n### What You Will Build\n- A method to identify communities that are at high risk of fraud in P2P networks\n  \n### What You Will Learn\n- How to prepare and project your data for graph analytics\n- How to use community detection to identify fraud\n- How to read and write directly from and to your snowflake tables\n\n"

Set up the [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN/neo4j-neo4j-graph-analytics) application within Snowflake.\n2. Prepare and project your data into a graph model (stations as nodes, lines as relationships).\n3. Ran dijkstra to find the shortest path between two stations and to model alternative routes if a station was closed\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Neo4j Graph Analytics Documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/)\n- [Installing Neo4j Graph Analytics on SPCS](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/installation/)\n"
