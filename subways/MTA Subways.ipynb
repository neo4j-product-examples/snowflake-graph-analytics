    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. **Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake** brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake!

    "3.6 million Americans ride the New York City subway each day. That's 1.3 million more people than who takes a flight each day in the United States. The New York City Subway is unique in the number of riders, stations, and the level of service it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Graph Analytics for Snowflake, we can easily model what would happen if a station was fully closed for repairs. Insights like this can apply not just to transport systems, but to supply chains, manufacturing processes and much more.\n",

    "- The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN) for Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Need\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below:\n",
