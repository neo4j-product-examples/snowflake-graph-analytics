    "By working with a patient transaction dataset, you were able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN/neo4j-neo4j-graph-analytics) application within Snowflake.\n",
    "2. Prepare and project your data into a graph model (patients as nodes, underwent_procedures as relationships).\n",
    "3. Ran node similarity to identify patients who have a comparable history of medical procedures.\n",
