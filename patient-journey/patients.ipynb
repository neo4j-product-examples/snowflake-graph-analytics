    "### What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake? \n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. **Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake** brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN) for Snowflake\n",
    "  \n",
    "### What You Will Need\n",
    "- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below:\n",
