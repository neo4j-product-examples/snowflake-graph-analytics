    "\n",
    "### What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake? \n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. **Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake** brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Risk in a Manufacturing Plant with Neo4j Graph Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart shows how to model a manufacturing workflow in Neo4j and apply Graph Analytics algorithms to find structural risks, operational bottlenecks, and machine similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN) for Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create a **graph projection**, which combines the nodes and their relationships into a single in-memory graph.\n",
    "- How to conduct a **connectivity analysis**, which utilizes Weakly Connected Components to identify any isolated subsystem.\n",
    "- How to conduct a **criticality ranking** by using PageRank to find influential machines and Betweenness Centrality to identify bridges that control workflow.\n",
    "- How to calculate **structural embeddings and similarity**. First generate FastRP embeddings and then run KNN to group machines with similar roles or dependencies.\n",
