    "### What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Communities of Fraudulent Claims\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance fraud is estimated to drain \\$308–309 billion annually, affecting all lines—including auto, health, property & casualty, and workers’ compensation. As a result, the average U.S. family pays an extra \\$400–\\$700 per year in premiums. This highlights the critical need for early detection of fraudulent claims to prevent such substantial financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "The Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN/neo4j-neo4j-graph-analytics) for Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Need:\n",
    "- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<<<INSERT SNAPSHOT OF SNOWFLAKE MARKETPLACE IMAGE>>>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Build:\n",
    "- A method to compare complex insurance cases to one another and identify the ones that are at risk of being fraudulent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to prepare and project your data for graph analytics\n",
    "- How to use Weakly Connected Components to identify potential clusters of fraudulent activity\n",
    "- How to create node embeddings to understand the structure of the graph \n",
    "- How to use K-nearest neighbors algorithm to find highly similar nodes in the graph\n",
    "- How to read and write directly from and to your Snowflake tables\n",

    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "This dataset is designed to model and analyze insurance claims for the purpose of identifying fraudulent activity using graph analytics. Given the complexity of the data model, all contextual relationships captured in the graph will be leveraged when comparing claims. This will enable deeper insights beyond isolated data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of the demo, the database will be named `I_DEMO`. Using the CSV, `insurance_claims_full.csv`, found here <<<ADD DATASET LINK>>>, we are going to create a new table called `insurance_claims_full` via the Snowsight data upload method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow through this Snowflake [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-web-ui) on creating a table from 'Load data using the web interface'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pop up, \n",
    "1. Upload the CSV `insurance_claims_full.csv` using the browse option. \n",
    "2. Under `Select or create a database and schema`, please create a database with name `I_DEMO`.\n",
    "3. Under `Select or create a table`, please click on the '+' symbol and create a new table named `insurance_claims_full`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Permissions\n",
    "One of the most usefull aspects of Snowflake is the ability to have roles with specific permissions, so that you can have many people working in the same database without worrying about security. The Neo4j app requires the creation of a few different roles. But before we get started granting different roles, we need to ensure that you are using `accountadmin` to grant and create roles. Lets do that now:"

    "## Insurance Claims Embeddings and Similarity\n",
    "Duration 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncovering complex fraud patterns in insurance claims requires more than tracing obvious links between entities. To detect subtle signals of collusion or anomalous behavior, we turn to **structural embeddings** — numerical summaries that capture how each claim fits within the broader network.\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming the graph structure into a vector space, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect clusters of claims that fulfill similar structural roles\n",
    "- Surface outliers whose behavior deviates from typical claim patterns\n",
    "- Flag candidates for further review based on similarity to known fraudulent activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach leverages two key graph algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fast Random Projection (FastRP):**\n",
    "  This algorithm generates a concise 16-dimensional vector for each claim, reflecting the shape of its surrounding network. Claims embedded in similar structural contexts — such as being part of a fraud ring — will yield similar vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**\n",
    "  Once embeddings are in place, KNN finds the most structurally similar claims using cosine similarity. This allows us to identify networks of claims that may not be directly connected but exhibit comparable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining structural embeddings with similarity search, we move beyond surface-level connections and begin to model how fraud operates across the entire claims graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about these algorithms in our [documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/current/algorithms/).\n"

    "\n",
    "These embeddings aren't directly interpretable, but when two claims have very similar embeddings, it strongly suggests they occupy comparable positions in the network. They may share the same types of connections to incidents, entities, or locations — potentially indicating coordinated behavior or copycat strategies.\n",
