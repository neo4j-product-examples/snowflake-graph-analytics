   "source": "# Detecting Insurance Fraud Using Graph Algorithms with Neo4j\n---\n## Overview \n\nDuration: 2 mins\n\n### What Is Neo4j Graph Analytics For Snowflake?\n\nNeo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake!\n\n### Identifying Communities of Fraudulent Claims\n\nInsurance fraud is estimated to drain \\$308–309 billion annually, affecting all lines—including auto, health, property & casualty, and workers’ compensation. As a result, the average U.S. family pays an extra \\$400–\\$700 per year in premiums. This highlights the critical need for early detection of fraudulent claims to prevent such substantial financial losses.\n\n### Prerequisites\nThe Native App [Neo4j Graph Analytics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZH40CN/neo4j-neo4j-graph-analytics) for Snowflake\n\n### What You Will Need:\n- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below: \n\n<<<INSERT SNAPSHOT OF SNOWFLAKE MARKETPLACE IMAGE>>>\n\n### What You Will Build:\n- A method to compare complex insurance cases to one another and identify the ones that are at risk of being fraudulent.  \n\n### What You Will Learn:\n\n- How to prepare and project your data for graph analytics\n- How to use Weakly Connected Components to identify potential clusters of fraudulent activity\n- How to create node embeddings to understand the structure of the graph \n- How to use K-nearest neighbors algorithm to find highly similar nodes in the graph\n- How to read and write directly from and to your Snowflake tables\n\n\n\n\n"

Given the complexity of the data model, all contextual relationships captured in the graph will be leveraged when comparing claims. This will enable deeper insights beyond isolated data points.\n\n<<<INSERT SNAPSHOT OF DATA MODEL IMAGE>>>\n\nFor the purposes of the demo, the database will be named `I_DEMO`. Using the CSV, `insurance_claims_full.csv`, found here <<<ADD DATASET LINK>>>, we are going to create a new table called `insurance_claims_full` via the Snowsight data upload method. \n\nFollow through this Snowflake [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-web-ui) on creating a table from 'Load data using the web interface'.\n\nIn the pop up, \n1. Upload the CSV `insurance_claims_full.csv` using the browse option. \n2. Under `Select or create a database and schema`, please create a database with name `I_DEMO`.\n3. Under `Select or create a table`, please click on the '+' symbol and create a new table named `insurance_claims_full`.\n\nNow, a new table named `insurance_claims_full` will be created under `i_demo.public` with the provided CSV."

The Neo4j app requires the creation of a few different roles. But before we get started granting different roles, we need to ensure that you are using `accountadmin` to grant and create roles.

To detect subtle signals of collusion or anomalous behavior, we turn to **structural embeddings** — numerical summaries that capture how each claim fits within the broader network.\n\nBy transforming the graph structure into a vector space, we can:\n\n- Detect clusters of claims that fulfill similar structural roles\n- Surface outliers whose behavior deviates from typical claim patterns\n- Flag candidates for further review based on similarity to known fraudulent activity\n\nOur approach leverages two key graph algorithms:\n\n**Fast Random Projection (FastRP):**\n  This algorithm generates a concise 16-dimensional vector for each claim, reflecting the shape of its surrounding network. Claims embedded in similar structural contexts — such as being part of a fraud ring — will yield similar vectors.\n\n**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**\n  Once embeddings are in place, KNN finds the most structurally similar claims using cosine similarity. This allows us to identify networks of claims that may not be directly connected but exhibit comparable behavior.\n\nBy combining structural embeddings with similarity search, we move beyond surface-level connections and begin to model how fraud operates across the entire claims graph.\n\nYou can find more information about these algorithms in our [documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/current/algorithms/).\n"

High-scoring pairs are good candidates for closer review to detect possible collusion or fraud.\n"

Let's take a look at our original table and find claims that appear to be structurally the same as fraudulent claims. We are looking for claims that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. They are not currently marked as fraudulent\n2. They have a knn score of \"1\" with a claim that has already been marked as fraudulent\n\nThis can give us an idea of the universe of potentially missed fraudulent claims."

Set up the Neo4j Graph Analytics application within Snowflake.\n2. Prepare and project your data into a graph model (users as nodes, transactions as relationships).\n3. Ran Weakly Connected Components to identify potential clusters of fraudulent activity.\n4. Ran Node Embeddings and K Nearest Neighbors to identify the structure of nodes in the graph and identify highly similar claims.\n\n### Resources\n- [Neo4j Graph Analytics Documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/)\n- [Installing Neo4j Graph Analytics on SPCS](https://neo4j.com/docs/snowflake-graph-analytics/installation/)"
