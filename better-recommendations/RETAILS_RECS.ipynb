   "source": "# Better Recommendations Using Graph Analytics\n\nRecommendations are big business. Amazon reports that 35% of its revenue comes from recommendations. Even more surprisingly, Netflix and YouTube report that 75% and 70% of what people watch on their platforms comes from recommendations. That means the majority of what we buy, watch, or even listen to is shaped by algorithms working quietly in the background.\n\nWe will be using Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake to build our recommendations. Graph powered recommendations go deeper than traditional methods because they intuitively model user behavior.\n\nIn our example, we will be looking at co-purchasing behavior built off of data sampled from Instakart. We will discover how simply looking at items that are most frequently purchased together isn’t enough to build a good recommendation, and interestingly might cause us to recommend products that customers were already planning on buying without our intervention.\n\nSo how do we build a good recommendation engine? What techniques power these systems, and how can you start applying them yourself? Well, follow along to find out!"
