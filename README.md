# Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake

Please see the folders within here for worked examples for Snowflake. If you would like to write a quickstart for snowflake, please create a new folder with the code for your worked example and README.md file with the content of the quickstart. Upon completion, please contact Corydon Baylor in marketing for review.

## Worked Examples
Currently, we have a few worked examples to use:
- [Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/blob/main/predictive-maintenance-manufacturing/README.md): This example works through the most commonly used algorithms to handle tasks like community detection, centrality, and similarity
- [Modeling Disruptions in NYC Subways](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/modeling-disruptions-subways): See how a network responds to different disruptions
- [Patient Journey](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/patient-journey): Identify patients who have a similar medical history and sort them into groups
- [Insurance Fraud](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/insurance-fraud): Use graph embeddings to convert the graph model into vector representations and compare them against previously labeled fraud cases
- [Fraud in P2P](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/louvain): Use louvain to identify connected fraud in a peer-to-peer context

## Snowflake's Formatting
Snowflake requires a particular format, which they outline [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts) 

```
# H1 Headers Like This Will be the Title of the Quickstart

## H2 Headers will Denote a New "Slide" in the Quickstart
```
## Required Content
In general, we will need the following content:
- An overview slide (format shown below)
- Where to get the data
- How to set up permissions
- How to clean the data (if needed)
- Running the algorithm
- Examining results
- Conclusions and Resources 

## Overview Slide Content
Please include the following content in your Overview slide:
