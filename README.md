# Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake

Please see the folders within here for worked examples for Snowflake. If you would like to write a quickstart for snowflake, please create a new folder with the code for your worked example and README.md file with the content of the quickstart. Upon completion, please contact Corydon Baylor in marketing for review.

## Worked Examples
Currently, we have a few worked examples to use:
- [Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/blob/main/predictive-maintenance-manufacturing/README.md): This example works through the most commonly used algorithms to handle tasks like community detection, centrality, and similarity
- [Modeling Disruptions in NYC Subways](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/modeling-disruptions-subways): See how a network responds to different disruptions
- [Patient Journey](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/patient-journey): Identify patients who have a similar medical history and sort them into groups
- [Insurance Fraud](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/insurance-fraud): Use graph embeddings to convert the graph model into vector representations and compare them against previously labeled fraud cases
- [Fraud in P2P](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/louvain): Use louvain to identify connected fraud in a peer-to-peer context
- [Entity Resolution](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/snowflake-graph-analytics/tree/main/entity-resolution): Use embeddings + KNN to detect similar entities, map those relationships and finally use louvain to determine if they should belong to the same entity.
