# WCC Business Executives

The Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm finds sets of connected nodes in directed and undirected graphs. Two nodes are connected, if there exists a path between them. The set of all nodes that are connected with each other form a component.

This example uses data that was sourced from `Relationship 360 - People Business Intelligence Sample (Massachusetts)`. This data set is a free dataset that is available in the Snowflake Marketplace.

This database must be copied into your Snowflake environment.

 A method is provided in `WCC Example.ipynb` to load the data from the [Relationship 360 - People Business Intelligence Sample (Massachusetts)](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ2FQZ711VO/equilar-relationship-360-people-business-intelligence-sample-massachusetts) database.

## Running WCC on the Business Data in Snowflake

The `WCC Example.ipynb` provides the steps to run the WCC algorithm within the Snowflake application `Neo4j Graph Analytics` inside your Snowflake account.
