    "### What is Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake? \n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j helps organizations find hidden relationships and patterns across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. **Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake** brings to the power of graph directly to Snowflake, allowing users to run 65+ ready-to-use algorithms on their data, all without leaving Snowflake! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discovering Communities in P2P Fraud\n",
    "P2P Fraud Losses are Skyrocketing. 8% of banking customers reported being victims of P2P Scams in the past year, and the average loss to these scams was $176.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding different communities within P2P transactions is the first step towards identifying and ultimately ending P2P fraud. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- The Native App Neo4j Graph Analytics for Snowflake\n",
    "  \n",
    "### What You Will Need\n",
    "- Active Snowflake account with appropriate access to databases and schemas.\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Analytics application installed from the Snowflake marketplace. Access the marketplace via the menu bar on the left hand side of your screen, as seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "- How to prepare and project your data for graph analytics\n",
    "- How to use community detection to identify fraud\n",
    "- How to read and write directly from and to your snowflake tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Build\n",
